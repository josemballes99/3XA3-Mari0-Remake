This document will show the different requirements will be testing and the rationale behind some of the tests that we choose. Furthermore, this document will show what will be demonstrating along with how the tests will be conducted. 

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
Testing is a critical part of developing software to both ensure the program meets the project's requirements and to address the errors of the product. 
\subsection{Scope}
In regard to our project, the game Mari0, the tests implemented will need to be carefully chosen in order to ensure that the game is above all else, fun. The chosen tests must also give the stakeholders of the project the assurance and confidence that the game plays and functions accordingly to the requirements outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. Testing will be automated where possible, however it is a necessity to test for certain attributes of the game manually.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
	This document will describe our project of reimplementing Mari0, the test team and the tools and frameworks that they will be using, and a list and description of the tests we will be using to ensure our game meets the requirements listed in the SRS.
\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
The core game mechanics of Mari0 involve the simple platforming mechanics of moving left or right, and jumping; in addition to portals which allow characters and objects to be teleported between two portals while maintaining their physical characteristics.
\subsection{Test Team}
All members of Ninetendo, David Hobson, Jose Miguel Ballesteros, and Jeff Pineda, are to actively create and implement tests and test cases, and are also responsible for recording each tests' results.
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
If a method being written can be tested automatically, the test will be concurrently written alongside it or shortly after the method's completion. In addition, in order to ensure that all code has been tested effectively, white box testing will be used. 
\subsection{Manual Testing Approach}
Many of the manual tests will be done by players/beta testers to ensure that the game reacts accordingly. A black box testing approach will be used for beta testing when users play our game and will ensure that outputs make sense for the game. 
\subsection{Testing Tools}
As mentioned in the technology section of our Development Plan document, we will be using the NUnit framework to conduct our unit tests. Manual testing will be done in the Unity play mode interface.

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

A proof on concept test will be used to show that the development for Mari0 is feasible with the current skills and technology we have available to us. This section describes the proof of concept test and the details associated with it.

\subsection{Demonstration Plan}
For a proof of concept test we will create a small prototype that will be ran from Unity that can be used on Windows 10, MacOS, and Ubuntu. The prototype will be a small game demo demonstrating collision detection with different in game objects, the main gravity system, and the portal interactions. Many of these different game elements will be implemented using the Unity's collision and physics engines, as this will make our final goal easier to achieve. The main  graphics that are used in the actual game will be used for this demo.

The prototype will be a floor that will be similar to the final game, which will be populated with the player character, six portals, two pipes, and platforms which the character can interact with. The player will be able to stand on the main floor and the platforms. There are also no walls to contain the character on either side.
The player (which will be represented by Mario) can be controlled in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}  
\item The player moves left and right with the 'a' and 'd' keys respectively
\item The player can jump by using the spacebar
\end{itemize}


The player will interact with the different objects in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}  
\item The floor will be the main platform that the user will be able to stand on.
\item The pipes will act like walls when approached from the side and not allow the user to pass through, and act like a floor when approached from the top.
\item All 6 portals are paired in different ways, when entering a blue portal, the character will exit the orange portal, and vice versa.
\item All physics will be maintained when entering through a portal, and portals can be on any surface that is at least two units.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Proof of Concept Demonstration}
Many of the things that are demonstrated in the proof of concept will be stated in the System Tests section of this document. These tests include. Player Movement, Portal Collision, and Ground and Wall Collision.
\begin{enumerate}

\item{Proof of Concept}

Type: Manual

Tester(s): Development Team and Colleagues

Description: Tests whether significant risks to the completion of the project can be overcome.

\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
	Since the functional and non-function requirements that Mari0 must meet are derived from the original implementation, all system tests that test whether or not these requirements are met will be the metric used to determine the likeness of our reimplementation to the original product.
	We will make sure that we test our product in parallel with the current product that is available. We will ensure that our game meets the same requirements as the original. These tests will include a lot of the non-functional requirements such as Look and Feel, and Performance Requirements. Many of the different functional requirements will also be tested alongside with the original product to ensure accuracy. These requirements will be movement, portal colllision, wall and ground collision, enemy collision, and player physics.  
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
	The NUnit framework will be used to conduct all unit tests of Mari0. We will conduct our testing in a manner that satisfies a complete condition coverage criteria. We will ensure code coverage by making sure that all code is being ran effectively and consistently. Furthermore, having the original product for parallel testing will allow us to see what parts of the code are missing and what needs to be implemented further.

\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
	Internal functions and methods that return any value type, such as integer, float, boolean, etc. can and will be tested dynamically, with player inputs or input conditions being given and comparing the actual output to the expected output. Due to the development and testing schedule, the use of drivers is not needed, and the use of stubs will be very limited if they are used at all. Since any video game is inherently dependant on player actions and how their interactions affect the game, we will be testing for complete condition coverage.
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		
	Mari0 will have no output files to be tested. The only output file the original implementation had was a saved game file that kept track of the players progress, however, due to limiting our reimplementation of the game to a single level, a save file is unnecessary.

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}

Since many functionalities of Mari0 are difficult to test, either due to testing having to be done manually or a bias by the development team during testing, the following usability survey questions have been listed to test some of these difficult functionalities

\begin{itemize}
  \item Are the portal mechanics intuitive and easy to understand?
  \item Do the controls feel smooth?
  \item Do you feel like you have full or good control of the character?
  \item Are the U.I. elements obtrusive? Easily readable? Aesthetically pleasing?
  \item Do you think the game is fair?
  \item Do you think the game is fun?
\end{itemize}

Each question above will have a score associated with it that beta testers will be able to fill out and reflect on the product. The score will be from 1 - 10, 1 being negative and poor, and 10 being positive and well done. We are looking for a score of about 8 or higher on average to ensure that we have created an excellent product.

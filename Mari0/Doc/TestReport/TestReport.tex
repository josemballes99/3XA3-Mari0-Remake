\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}

\textbf{Description:}
The following tests were executed by each member of our development team and a couple colleagues from our faculty. Engineering students were better suited for testing the current state of our project since it is an early development view of the open source game that is being recreated. Each participant was asked to give their honest feedback and suggestions.

\subsection{Look and Feel Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Game Environment\\}

\textbf{Results: }All testers were able to explore all the game environments without issues.
					
\item{Game Hude/Interface\\}

\textbf{Results: }All testers stated that the location of the counter was not not obstructive in their opinion.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Ease of Learning\\}

\textbf{Results: }All testers stated the game was easy to play and the controls were easy to learn.


\item{Entertainment\\}

\textbf{Results:} All testers stated that the game can be more enjoyable if it were stretched out to a longer period of time and had more gameplay, but is currently too short to provide a good amount of entertainment.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Controls/Commands\\}

\textbf{Results:} All testers noticed no delays or malfunction from the controls.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Operational and Environment Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Operating System Support\\}

\textbf{Results:} Each tester was able to run the game on their own operating system. These include Windows and OSX 10.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Altering Information\\}

\textbf{Results: }No tester indicated any type of alterations done to their current process or files.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Spelling and Grammar\\}

\textbf{Results:} All testers indicated that the game had no spelling or grammar mistakes.

\item{Offensive Content\\}

\textbf{Results: }The testers indicated that they found no source of offensive content that would be directed at them or people from another culture.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{License Adherence\\}

\textbf{Results: }The testers stated that they believe that the game is not breaching its current license.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Epileptic Prevention\\}

\textbf{Results: }The testers indicated that they believe that the game would not trigger any epileptic seizures, although it is worth noting that none of the testers has ever had a history of epileptic seizures.

\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

Since the functional and nonfunctional requirements that Mari0 must meet
are derived from the original implementation, all system tests that test
whether or not these requirements are met will be the metric used to de-
termine the likeness of our reimplementation to the original product. We made
 sure that we tested and compared our product to the current product
that is available. Our tests ensure that our game meets the same requirements
as the original. Our tests and surveys included a lot of the nonfunctional requirements 
such as Look and Feel, and Performance Requirements. Many of the
different functional requirements were tested alongside with the original 
product to ensure accuracy. These requirements will be movement, portal
colllision, wall and ground collision, enemy collision, and player physics.

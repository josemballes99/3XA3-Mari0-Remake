This document describes the requirements for Mari0  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to recreate the game, Mari0, to allow the players 
to entertain themselves and alleviate their boredom. Mari0 is a combination of
Super Mario Bros. and Portal, challenging a player's platforming abilities and their
puzzle solving skills.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for the Mari0 project is the game publisher.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for this project are people interested in platforming and/or puzzle games.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
The other stakeholders for Mari0 are the game's developers and designers.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
The constraints as mandated by our client are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Have each deliverable finished by the deadlines given in the course outline
	\item The game's physics will be handled by the Unity Game engine
	\item The product should be runnable on all operate systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\begin{tabular}{l l}
\hline
Term			& Definition \\
\hline
A.I.			 & Artificial Intelligence  \\
Portals      		 & Two connected portals that allow characters and projectiles to \\
			 & enter one and exit through the other, whilst mainting physial \\
			 & properties such as velocity and acceleration \\
Mario      		 & The character that the player portrays  \\
Goomba		 & Enemy character that is defeated after the player stomps on the top \\
			 & of its head	  \\
Lives			 & The amount of times the player can die before game over	\\
Question Block	 & Blocks found that when hit give the player coins or power ups	\\
Fire Flower		 & Type of power up, gives Mario the ability to throw fireballs	\\
Super Mushroom	 & Type of power up, lets Mario take an extra hit from enemies	\\

\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template.  This is where you can place
additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.
